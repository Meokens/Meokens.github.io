            <p>
              I realized what a huge impact advances in tech had on society and my life. I wanted to harness the power to positively affect the lives of people around me, especially those who tend to be marginalized or forgotten.

As a motivated student in UX Design, I worked on products for people with chronic pain. I realized how important and impactful it is to consider the needs of people with disabilities and how much I wanted to create products to help them.
